# microservices-GO

## Description

This is a simple microservices project using Golang. It is a simple project that demonstrates how to create a microservices project using Golang. The project is divided into two services: `user` and `post`. The `user` service is responsible for handling user-related operations, while the `post` service is responsible for handling post-related operations. The services communicate with each other using gRPC.

## Resp API

The next improvement is to add a REST API to the project. The REST API will be responsible for handling HTTP requests and communicating with the gRPC services. The REST API will be implemented using the `gin` framework.
